# multiplyR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of multiplyR is to allow my three children to play with
multiplication tables and experimenting their graphical representations
through a shiny App (and to make dad feel less guilty when he is coding
at home to experiment Bootstrap 5 functionnalities)

## Installation

You can install the development version of multiplyR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mhanf/multiplyR")
```

## Shiny apps

You can launch the multiplyR shiny app with :

``` r
run_app_multiplyr()
```

**!!! This work is in progress !!!**
